# Blog

This is my new blog, rebuilt yet again, this time on Astro, currently hosted on Netlify.

## Setting up

A local development environment is as simple as:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Production deployments through Netlify and Cloudflare Pages should "just work" if you point the app to the repository.
