About a month ago, I was working on a simple code project for school in some free time. It's a web site that takes simple phrases and makes a song out of them, based on the *99 bottles of beer* song.  I rediscovered the fun little script today, and you can see my song [here](http://mirror.phpizza.com/broncgeeks/s12/p5/HardmanA/projects/beer/beer.php?count=6&cont=hard+drive&fluid=code&prep=in&location=server&act=Take+one+out+because+it+died&end=Get+online+and+buy+some+more). When you write a song with it, the URL that shows the song will always show your song, so you can send that link around to share it with anyone!
