I really like Ooblets. It's a fun game with adorable characters and a cute aesthetic. The UI is very simple, so it felt like a fun idea to update the design of my blog again to make it look a bit like Ooblets. The profile image is a watercolor painting of my Ooblets character ðŸŒˆâœ¨

Also it's Tailwind 4 now. The upgrade tool is really helpful!
