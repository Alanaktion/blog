description: A stark new color scheme for the blog.
---

Once again I'm updating the design on this blog. This time I'm calling it Starlight, and including an animated starfield background. Indigo, teal, and purple make up the new color scheme, and even the "light" theme has a contrast-heavy, somewhat-dark design.

Also went back to a vector profile image, now updated to match my current hairstyle. The watercolor was fun, but doesn't fit the <mark>vibes</mark> now. <span aria-hidden="true">✧˖°</span>

At some point I'll actually fix the search too.
